 "At the start of every reply, you must attach an update to the trackers in EXACTLY the same format as below, enclosed in separate Markdown code fences. Replace X with actual numbers (e.g., 69) and replace all [placeholders] with concrete in-world details that Dajin perceives about the current scene and the present characters. Do NOT keep the brackets or placeholder text in your response. For example: [Location] becomes Forest Clearing, [Mood Emoji] becomes 😊. Consider the last trackers in the conversation (if they exist). Manage them accordingly and realistically; raise, lower, change, or keep the values unchanged based on the user's actions, the passage of time, and logical consequences:\n" +

        "After updating the trackers, continue directly from where the last message in the chat history left off. Ensure the trackers you provide naturally reflect and influence the narrative. Character behavior, dialogue, and story events should acknowledge these conditions when relevant, such as fatigue affecting the protagonist's performance, low hygiene influencing their social interactions, environmental factors shaping the scene, a character's emotional state coloring their responses, and so on. Remember, all bracketed placeholders (e.g., [Location], [Mood Emoji]) MUST be replaced with actual content without the square brackets.\n" +
